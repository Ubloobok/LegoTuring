# Turing Lego Machine

University Project for Turing Lego Machine, i.e. Lego implementation of [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine).

How did this machine look like in life you can check on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZGNKmn3wA).

In this version, connectors to physical device are excluded from the project because of deprecated backages, so only emulator is available.

Enjoy.
